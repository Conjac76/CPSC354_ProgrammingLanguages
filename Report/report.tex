\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This report will document my learning through the course. The content will be structured week by week, with sections on mathematical notes, homework solutions, and personal reflections on the topics discussed.

\section{Week by Week}\label{homework}

\subsection{Week 1}

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Proof}

Proving that $37x + q = 37x + q$ demonstrates the reflexivity property of equality. Reflexivity states that any mathematical expression is equal to itself. In this case, the expression $37x + q$ is compared to itself, and it is immediately clear by the reflexivity of equality that this statement is true.

\subsubsection*{Proof in Lean}

In Lean, the theorem $37x + q = 37x + q$ is proven using the `rfl` tactic. The `rfl` tactic in Lean stands for "reflexivity" and handles proofs of the form $X = X$. When `rfl` is executed, Lean verifies that both sides of the equation are equal and the proof is complete.

The command to execute in Lean is simply:
\begin{verbatim}
rfl
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Connection Between Lean and Mathematics}

In mathematics, we rely on the axiom of reflexivity to assert that $37x + q = 37x + q$. Likewise, in Lean, the `rfl` tactic automates this process by invoking the same principle. The use of `rfl` in Lean serves as a direct representation of reflexivity in mathematical logic, providing an automated and formalized way to conclude that an expression is equal to itself.

Thus, both in Lean and in traditional mathematics, the proof of $37x + q = 37x + q$ is an application of the same fundamental concept: the reflexivity of equality.

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Proofs and Lean Implementation}

\textbf{Theorem (Associativity of Addition):} For all natural numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, the addition operation is associative: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.

\textit{Proof:} By induction on $c$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Case:} When $c = 0$, we have:
    \[
    (a + b) + 0 = a + (b + 0)
    \]
    Using the property addition with zero, this simplifies to:
    \[
    a + b = a + b
    \]
    This equality holds by the reflexivity of equality

    \item \textbf{Inductive Step:} Assume the hypothesis holds for some $d$
    \[
    (a + b) + d = a + (b + d)
    \]
    We must prove $c = \text{succ}(d)$:
    \[
    (a + b) + \text{succ}(d) = a + (b + \text{succ}(d))
    \]
    this can be rewritten as:
    \[
    \text{succ}((a + b) + d) = \text{succ}(a + (b + d))
    \]
    By the inductive hypothesis, we know $(a + b) + d = a + (b + d)$, so:
    \[
    \text{succ}((a + b) + d) = \text{succ}(a + (b + d))
    \]
    This completes the proof of associativity.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Connection to Lean Proof of Associativity of Addition:}

The Lean proof is the same structure of the mathematical proof:

\begin{verbatim}
induction c with d hd
-- Base case
rw [add_zero]  -- Simplifies (a + b) + 0 to a + b using add_zero
rw [add_zero]  -- Simplifies a + (b + 0) to a + b using add_zero
rfl            -- Reflexivity: confirms a + b = a + b
-- Inductive step
rw [add_succ]  -- Rewrites (a + b) + succ d as succ ((a + b) + d)
rw [hd]        -- Applies the inductive hypothesis: (a + b) + d = a + (b + d)
rw [add_succ]  -- Rewrites a + (b + succ d) as succ (a + (b + d))
rw [add_succ]  -- Confirms that the expressions on both sides match
rfl            -- Reflexivity: confirms succ (a + (b + d)) = succ (a + (b + d))
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Explanation:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Base Case in Lean:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{rw [add\_zero]} is used twice to simplify both sides of the equation to $a + b$, directly corresponding to the mathematical step where $a + b = a + b$ is shown by reflexivity.
      \item \texttt{rfl} is then used to verify
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Inductive Step in Lean:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{rw [add\_succ]} rewrites the expression using the definition of addition with the successor, corresponding to the mathematical step where we transition from $(a + b) + \text{succ}(d)$ to $\text{succ}((a + b) + d)$.
      \item \texttt{rw [hd]} applies the inductive hypothesis, mirroring the assumption that $(a + b) + d = a + (b + d)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Week 2 questions}

\textbf{Question:} Can Lean be used to verify complex operations in critical systems such as financial transactions or autonomous vehicles? What are the limitations of its use in such a high stakes environment?

\subsection{Week 3}

\textbf{Discord Name:} connorjacobs

\textbf{Discord Posting:} In my research, I took a look at how advancements in programming languages have balanced performance, safety, and ease of use, focusing on Rust and TypeScript. Rust’s ownership model enforces memory safety by controlling how data is accessed and managed, preventing issues like memory leaks and race conditions without garbage collection. In contrast, TypeScript enhances JavaScript by introducing type checking, catching type errors early, and improving overall code reliability.
